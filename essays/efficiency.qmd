As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Your essay should address the following questions:

-   What is the definition of “efficiency”?

-   What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

-   What does efficiency allow you to do?

-   Why is efficiency important?

-   Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some [“a-ha” moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

Efficiency, in regards to statistical computing, is the optimal use of the computer's resources, such as time and memory, to achieve the desired outcome. Efficient code is not just about being correct, but getting results quickly while reducing consumption of resources through a variety of methods.

Efficiency can be observed as streamlined workflows, reduced computation times, and well-structured code. This might include implementing vectorized operations instead of loops and using efficient data structures. Functions such as across embodies this, as it inherently is a loop, however not needing to create a loop to achieve its success. Efficiently also bleeds into the human effort, such as writing clear, reusable, well-documented code, which saves time for both the creator and collaborators in future analysis or uses of the code.

This comes together to unlock scalability and flexibility, enabling data scientists to handle larger datasets and more complex analyses without compromising speed or accuracy. It also allows for repetative experimentation, letting analysts focus on exploring and refining their models rather than troubleshooting bottlenecks. Ultimately, efficiency leads to more productive and meaningful work.

Overall, efficiency is critical in statistical computing because modern data science often involves large-scale datasets and intensive computing methods. Inefficient practices can lead to excessive processing times, higher resource usage, and potential errors in analyses. By working efficiently, data scientists can save these valuable resources, create reproduciable workflows, and ensure their solutions are scalable.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of efficiency, there were definitely plenty of "a-ha" moments that came about when working to improve the effectiveness of code within the portfolio. One example could be found in section PE-1 through the use of the across function. If I want to alter the observations within each column, one would thing to go through them manually and input the selection themselves. However, the across function automates this, allowing mass data modification while keeping code structure simple and not requiring a loop. This creates the streamlined code we want, allowing for repeatability and scalability with any dataset. Another major discovery was the implementation of functions made by the user. Such as in section PE-2 of the portfolio, having the ability to create our own functions allows us to break-apart out code into sections and create functions to achieve a specific goal. These modular designs allow for faster processing, therefore increasing efficiency by using less computing power overall. This also branches to the human part of it, as large chunks of code can be very difficult to look at, reducing the efficiency of understanding the code. Breaking the larger code into smaller, specialized chunks, we can provide a more readable code chunk and easier interpretation, as long as the function are formatted so. Combining all of these operations leads to code that could effectivly be used and understood by anyone, while not consuming more than the code should.
